	<h1>Perky / zFarm updates</h1>

	<h2>2.3 — 2017-11-??</h2>
	<h3>Common</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Hybrid notation and extended Standard notation are now supported.
	</ul>
	<h3>Perky</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Map caches are now taken into account (this shifts the Motivation-Looting balance a bit).
		<li>New presets for the feats Nerfed and Tent City.
		<li>The Trapper² preset now recommends points in Bait when relevant, making it usable mid-game.
		<li>New warnings when using “respec” presets incorrectly.
	</ul>
	<h3>zFarm</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Stopped recommending BW farming (never worth more than a small map with a resource cache).
		<li>Started recommending Extra Zones maps (only if you can afford them)
		<li>Life and Obliterated challenges are now supported.
		<li>Hyperspeed II is now taken into account.
		<li>New warning against farming on even Lead zones.
		<li>Reworded some messages (hopefully they’re less confusing, now).
		<li>Base loot is now displayed as a percentage of world-level loot.
		<li>New auto-filled input: “Fragments”
		<li>The auto-filled input “Challenge health” now uses multipliers instead of percentages (to avoid displaying Obliterated as +99999999999900%).
		<li>Auto-filled inputs “Agility” and “Hyperspeed” were merged into “Attack speed”.
		<li>Auto-filled inputs for the 3 nature empowerments were replaced by a single input for the currently active nature.
		<li>Bugfix: enemy health is now counted correctly on Lead and Coordinate.
	</ul>

	<h2>2.2.1</h2>
	<h3>Perky</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>“Target Zone” is now saved, like the other inputs.
		<li>More accurate valuation of Pheromones and Bait pre-z70.
		<li>New Overkill valuation.
		<li>The Scientist preset now fixes Coord=0.
		<li>Bugfix: stop assuming block pierce pre-z60.
		<li>Bugfix: don’t crash when a 0 He save is pasted.
	</ul>
	<h3>zFarm</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Spire II+ handling.
		<li>Bugfix: account for the magmamancermancy cap.
		<li>Bugfix: no longer consider multiple natures to be active at the same.
		<li>Bugfix: switching between trapper² and metal² presets no longer messes advanced options.
		<li>Bugfix: trimp² preset was overvaluing population.
	</ul>

	<h2>2.2 — 2017-10-10<h2>
	<h3>Perky</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Lots of new presets!
		<li>Stopped suggesting removing points from perks if no respec is available.
		<li>Removed “Weight: Overkill”. This is now set automatically. You can still override it by adding OK to your “Fixed perks”.
		<li>An appropriate preset is now selected automatically when a save is pasted and no weights have ever been set manually.
		<li>Better display on small screens.
	</ul>
	<h3>zFarm</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Removed the misleading “highest zone where you one-shot everything” message.
	</ul>

	<h2>2.1 — 2017-10-05<h2>
	<h3>Common</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Small graphical changes.
		<li>Toggling manual inputs now works using cookies, instead of adding <tt>#advanced</tt> to the URL.
	</ul>
	<h3>Perky</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Helium left over is now displayed.
		<li>Added a “More Info” toggle, to display the cost and total spent on each perk.
		<li>Added a “Share” button.
		<li>“Fixed perks” can now be used to set maximums/minimums for perks, by using <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>=</tt>.
		<li>Bugfix: fixing a perk to 0 now works correctly.
		<li>Bugfix: income was slightly overvalued late-game due to a math mistake.
		<li>Bugfix: selecting the Spire preset then another one no longer messes up your options.
		<li>Bugfix: extremely high helium no longer causes “Health is Infinity” errors (tested up to 1e100 He).
		<li>Bugfix: compatibility with the Pale Moon browser.
	</ul>

	<h2>2.0 — 2017-09-30</h2>
	<h3>Common</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added a changelog! Sorry for not doing that sooner.
		<li>Scientific, engineering and alphabetic notations are now supported.
		<li>Unexpected errors are now reported prominently, instead of silently displaying bogus results.
		<li>Renamed “advanced options” to “manual input”. Everything in there is auto-filled when pasting a save.
	</ul>
	<h3>Perky</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Generated housing estimation is now based on target zone instead of HZE (fixes <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Trimps/comments/739znc/using_the_dimensional_generator_makes_perky_want/>this bug</a>).
		<li>Generated housing estimation is now much more accurate for late-game.
		<li>Fixed a bug where the Spire preset would still recommend Looting and Resourceful.
		<li>Improved the algorithm to limit over-spending on low-impact perks (Resourceful, Pheromones).
		<li>Removed “Round Spire perks”. Rounding is now done automatically, so that perk levels always fit in 3 digits.
		<li>Removed “Devalue income”. Perky now estimates how many equipment levels will be affordable and values income accordingly.
		<li>Moved “Fixed perks” from the advanced options to the main options.
		<li>“Fixed perks” now accepts abbreviated perk names, such as P2, looty II, OK, resi, and many others.
		<li>Added two auto-filled inputs: “Production mod” and “Loot mod”. For metal² and trapper², Production mod should be set to 0.
	</ul>
